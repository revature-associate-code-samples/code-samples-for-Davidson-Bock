# Project 0: Banking App
This project simulates a banking application. In this application, a user is able to log in or sign up. Validation is a key feature where a user can only log in if they enter the correct credentials. For signing up, a user's username has to be unique. Once a user is able to log in, they have an option to create a bank account (checking, savings, or credit). A user is can then select any of their bank accounts to withdraw from or deposit to. If a user attempts to withdraw more money in an account than they currently have, the application will present an error.

# Project 1: Reimbursment App
This project is a full stack application where a user can submit a reimbursment for a particular topic (food, travel, lodging, etc) with the amount they wish to reimburse for. A user can also view their pass reimbursments and check whether it has been approved or not. A different type of user (a manager) can log in a view the pending reimbursment requests and can either approve it or deny it.

# Project 2: Movie Fanatics 
This project is a full stack application that displays movies and actors alike. Users are able to search for a particular movie or actor. A user is able to create an account in order to access additional features such as rating a movie, reviewing a movie, or rating other members (in terms of their reviews on movies) in the application.
