# Project 0: Banking App
This project simulates a banking application. In this application, a user is able to log in or sign up. Validation is a key feature where a user can only log in if they enter the correct credentials. For signing up, a user's username has to be unique. Once a user is able to log in, they have an option to create a bank account (checking, savings, or credit). A user is can then select any of their bank accounts to withdraw from or deposit to. If a user attempts to withdraw more money in an account than they currently have, the application will present an error.
