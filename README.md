# Project 0: Banking App
This project simulates a banking application. In this application, a user is able to log in or sign up. Validation is a key feature where a user can only log in if they enter the correct credentials. For signing up, a user's username has to be unique. Once a user is able to log in, they have an option to create a bank account (checking, savings, or credit). A user is can then select any of their bank accounts to withdraw from or deposit to. If a user attempts to withdraw more money in an account than they currently have, the application will present an error.

Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.

# Project 2: Movie Fanatics 
MovieFanatic is a dynamic web application with an intuitive user interface that allows both guests and logged in members to the website to view a featured movie, the most popular movies, best reviewed movies of the year, comedies and dramas all on the home page. When a movie is selected, the user is brought to the movie view, where everything from the director, producers, and cast to the tag line, imdb and rotten tomatoes scores, plot summary and more is available to see. Click on a director, actor or producer in the movie view, and you are taken to a different view, where you can see an actor or directorâ€™s profile image, birthdate, popularity, and biography. Below there is also a display showing the movies that the actor or director has appeared in. Throughout the application, there is a search bar near the top of the page where users can search for any movie by title, as well as actors and directors by name. Once logged in, additional features are available to the user such as rating a movie, adding a movie to a favorite list and adding reviews for each movie.
